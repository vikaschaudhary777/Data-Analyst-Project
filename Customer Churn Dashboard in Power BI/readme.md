# README: Customer Churn Analysis Project

Overview

This project involves analyzing customer churn data to uncover insights that can help reduce churn rates and improve customer retention strategies. The project consists of the following key components:

Dataset File: 02 Customer Churn-Dataset.xlsx - This file contains the dataset for the analysis.

Dashboard File: Customer Churn Dashboard.pbix - This Power BI dashboard visualizes key metrics and insights derived from the data.

Dataset Details

File: 02 Customer Churn-Dataset.xlsx

Description: This Excel file contains detailed records of customer data and their churn status. It is the foundational dataset for this project.

Structure:

Columns (example):

CustomerID: Unique identifier for each customer.

Gender: Gender of the customer.

Age: Age of the customer.

Tenure: Duration of service in months.

Service Type: Type of services subscribed.

Monthly Charges: Monthly fee paid by the customer.

Churn: Binary indicator of whether the customer has churned.

Instructions for Use:

Open the file in Microsoft Excel or similar software to view and edit the dataset.

Ensure data integrity by verifying that columns and rows align correctly.

Any preprocessing steps (e.g., handling missing values) should be documented before analysis.

Dashboard Details

File: Customer Churn Dashboard.pbix

Description: This Power BI dashboard is built to provide visual insights into customer churn patterns.

Features:

Key Performance Indicators (KPIs):

Overall churn rate.

Average tenure of churned vs. retained customers.

Monthly revenue impact from churned customers.

Visualization Types:

Pie charts for demographic distribution.

Line charts for churn trends over time.

Heatmaps for churn rates by service type and monthly charges.

Instructions for Use:

Open the file in Power BI Desktop.

Refresh data sources to ensure the dashboard reflects the latest information.

Customize visualizations or filters as needed.

Project Objectives

Identify key factors contributing to customer churn.

Segment customers based on churn likelihood.

Develop strategies to reduce churn rates and enhance customer retention.

Getting Started

Prerequisites:

Software:

Microsoft Excel (for viewing/editing the dataset).

Power BI Desktop (for viewing/editing the dashboard).

Skills: Basic understanding of data analysis and visualization.

Steps to Begin:

Download both files and store them in a local directory.

Open the dataset file and review its structure.

Launch the Power BI dashboard and explore key insights.

Customization and Enhancement

Suggestions:

Add additional metrics, such as lifetime value (LTV) of customers.

Include advanced machine learning models to predict churn likelihood.

Enhance the dashboard with interactive filters for deeper analysis.

Notes and Best Practices

Always maintain a backup of the original dataset and dashboard files.

Document any modifications to the dataset or dashboard.

Validate insights by cross-referencing with business goals and external data.
